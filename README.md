# Identifying Emerging Use Cases of Baking Soda from User-Generated Content

**Project description:** Final Project for ALY 6080 â€“ Integrated Experiential Learning

### Background

This course was a practicum in executing a data analytics project for a sponsoring organization.  

### Project Description

My team was assigned to an external marketing agency who was interested in learning about new and emerging uses of baking soda for one of their clients.  They had already used some commercially available software to scrape social media, e-commerce reviews, and blogs for mentions of baking soda, but needed us to help identify, sort, and analyze use cases of the product, as well as analysis of where baking soda use case conversations were happening on the internet.

### Individual Responsibility Within The Team

My primary role on the team was to explore text mining methods to identify use cases.  I also provided troubleshoting and debugging services for other team members' code and revised the final R Shiny dashboard code to run more efficiently.  Additionally, I came up with the idea and generated the simple code for a tool to randomly select one post about baking soda from the data and encouraged team members to insert it into their working versions of code, which ended up helping the team to identify some unique use cases of baking soda that the sponsor was not previously aware and excited to learn about.

### Going Beyond the Coursework

Although not used in the final analysis, I used this project to explore universal dependency parsing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE).

*Note: Only the code completely written by myself is included in this repository.*
